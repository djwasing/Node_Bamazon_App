# Node_Bamazon_App

This app uses Node.js, inquirer, and and MySQL database to prompt the user if they want to buy anything from a list of items.
The user selects an item, then the program prompts the user how many of that item they want to buy. After the user has selected an item and quantity the program displays the total cost of their order, and updates the remaining stock quantity of that item. 

Some of the challenges I encountered during this project was learning to use inquirer to get the response from the user. I was grateful to learn about columnify to list my items in an organized, easy-to-read list.
